# Third-party notices

Conduit's own source code is licensed under Apache-2.0. This file covers
third-party components that are redistributed with Android builds of Conduit and
remain under their own licenses.

Conduit release builds generate native binaries to provide the on-device local
Arch Linux shell. They are placed in `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`
(renamed to `lib*.so` so Android packages and extracts them) and are built from
the pinned [Termux](https://github.com/termux) package recipes for Android's
bionic libc.

GPL/LGPL license texts are included under
[`third_party/licenses`](third_party/licenses). Component-specific notices for
permissive/public-domain components are included under
[`third_party/notices`](third_party/notices). GPL/LGPL corresponding-source
details, exact upstream source archives, exact Termux package checksums, pinned
Termux package recipes, and the Conduit-side binary rewrite notes are included under
[`third_party/source-offer`](third_party/source-offer).

The root filesystem downloaded at runtime is an **Arch Linux ARM** (aarch64)
image distributed by Termux's
[proot-distro](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro) as a GitHub release
asset. Arch Linux ARM itself is maintained by the
[Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org) project; its packages carry their own
respective licenses. Conduit downloads this image to the device on first use and
does not redistribute it inside the app package.

## GPL/LGPL source offer

`proot` and `busybox` are GPL-2.0, GNU `tar` is GPL-3.0-or-later, and several
support libraries are LGPL. If you distribute Conduit with these binaries, make
the corresponding source available for the exact versions shipped. Conduit's
source-offer index is in
[`third_party/source-offer/README.md`](third_party/source-offer/README.md).

**Written offer.** This is a written offer, valid for at least three years from
the date Conduit distributes these binaries, to give any third party — for a
charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution — a
complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source for the GPL- and
LGPL-licensed binaries listed above, for the exact versions shipped. The
corresponding source is published at <https://github.com/gwitko/Conduit> under
[`third_party/source-offer`](third_party/source-offer); requests may also be
sent to the repository maintainer there. For the GPL-3.0 component (GNU `tar`)
this offer is additionally satisfied by access to the same Corresponding Source
from that network server at no charge (GPL-3.0 §6(d)).

Conduit includes a snapshot of the relevant Termux build recipes and patches at
[`third_party/source-offer/termux-recipes`](third_party/source-offer/termux-recipes),
pinned to Termux `termux-packages` commit
`ac296452b8ebec390cad3bce9060577c96099b10`. Conduit makes no source-code
changes to those projects. The only Conduit-side binary change is an in-place
rewrite of three `DT_NEEDED`/`SONAME` strings
(`libtalloc.so.2` -> `libtalloc.so`, `libbusybox.so.1.38.0` -> `libbusybox.so`,
`liblzma.so.5` -> `liblzma.so`)
so the libraries resolve under Android's `lib*.so`-only extraction. See the
source-offer index for the exact transformation and verification command.
